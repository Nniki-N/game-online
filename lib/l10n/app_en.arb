  "gameRulesText": "Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe! In this unique twist on the classic game, each player has 9 tokens of varying sizes: large, medium, and small. The goal is simple: be the first to place three of your tokens in a straight line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Here's how to play: \n\nPlayers take turns to put one of their tokens on any empty cell within the grid, aiming to form a winning combination. The twist lies in the stacking feature: larger tokens can be placed on top of smaller ones, regardless of whose token it is. \n\nYou win as soon as you arrange three of your tokens in a row. This could be a line that goes through the columns, rows, or diagonals of the grid. \n\nRemember, the game also ends if the entire grid is filled, and no player achieves a winning alignment. This creates an exciting balance between strategic placement and preventing your opponent from achieving victory. Get ready to engage in a multidimensional battle of wits and strategy!",
